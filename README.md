# KeepLore
KeepLore is a very simple plugin that has no commands or configuration at all. Simply install it on your server and forget about it. 

All the plugin does is maintain lore and display names on items that are placed and then broken again. These items are typically collectibles and it can be very annoying when a
player places the collectible on accident and loses the lore. KeepLore fixes that!

Although the plugin is simple, if there are any questions don't hesitate to reach out in my [Discord](https://discord.gg/CGgvDUz)
